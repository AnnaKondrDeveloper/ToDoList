<h1>To-Do-List App</h1> 
<br>
✔️ An application to add the To Do items in a checklist form. The user can also delete the item by just clicking on the checkbox.

<h2>Idea</h2>
It is a well known fact that writing things down in a list helps in better work management
Making such lists on a paper is a thing of the past
A Web-based application which allows user to type their list down and delete it when they are done with it
<h2>Tools Used</h2>
Used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (mongoose), EJS template engine, Lodash utility functions and JavaScript

<h2>How to use the application</h2>
The default list comes with a heading called "Today"
The user can change the heading according to the requirement. For Example:- If the user want to use a list for work, /work can be added as a suffix in the URL
To add an item, the user can click on the placeholder New Item and type the item which needs to be added
After typing it, the user can click on '+' button to add it in the list
When the user is done with the work mentioned in the list or if the user want to delete the item from the list, they can click on the checkbox beside that item and the item gets a strikethrough and gets deleted automatically
<h2>Important Note</h2>
The To-Do list app have a default page with Today as the title. If the user navigate to /work list, the item added in work list won't appear in any other list, say /shopping list.
The item added in a particular list will be persisted when the user navigates to different lists.
